BinaryData
==========
Used for storing and handling binary data in C++ programs. The binary data is represented as a std::vector\<unsigned char\>. The class provides methods for:

* Reading from stream
* Writing to stream
* Appending byte data
* Appending bit data
* Preprending byte data
* Shifting
* Byte swapping
* Reading sequence of bits
* Peeking sequence of bits
* Access to the raw binary data

The class is written to satisfy my own needs, so use it with caution and don't expect support from me.
